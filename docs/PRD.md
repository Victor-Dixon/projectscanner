# project-scanner PRD

## Purpose
project-scanner is a lightweight tool for generating a structured overview of a codebase. It supports Python, Rust, JavaScript and TypeScript files and produces JSON reports suitable for other tools or language models.

## Problem Statement
Developers often need quick insight into unfamiliar repositories. Manually exploring source files is time consuming. project-scanner automates static analysis so teams can rapidly understand project structure and feed the data into automation workflows.

## Solution Overview
- Multi-language parsing using ASTs (Python) and optional tree-sitter parsers (Rust/JS/TS)
- Incremental caching to skip unchanged files
- Concurrent file processing via worker threads
- Agent categorisation of Python classes by maturity and type
- Export of simplified context for ChatGPT or other LLM prompts
- Optional PyQt5 GUI viewer for generated JSON

## Key Features
1. **Command-line interface** to scan projects and manage options
2. **Report generator** merges analysis results and writes JSON files
3. **Plugin-style language analyser** for multiple languages
4. **Support for generating `__init__.py` files** after analysis
5. **ChatGPT context export** for LLM integrations

## Non-Goals
- Runtime or dynamic code analysis
- Automatic code generation or refactoring
- Deep language-specific metrics beyond simple complexity counts

## Success Metrics
- CLI produces valid JSON summaries for supported languages
- All unit tests pass (`pytest`)
- Scanning a medium-sized project (100+ files) finishes within a few minutes on a typical laptop

## Future Enhancements
- Packaging optional tree-sitter grammars for Rust and JavaScript
- Support for additional languages via plugins
- More granular complexity metrics and lint-style suggestions
